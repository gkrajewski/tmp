Two means were compared using t test and p value of .04 was obtained. It means that:
A) it is impossible to tell the probability of the alternative hypothesis
B) probability of obtaining a significant result is 96% (assuming that we can repeat the experiment infinite number of times)
C) probability of obtaining the difference we observe given the nullhypothesis is 4%
D) probability of the null hypothesis (no difference between the means on the population level) is 4%
ANSWER: A

Two means were compared using t test and p value of .025 was obtained. In such a case:
A) it is impossible to tell the probability of the alternative hypothesis
B) probability of obtaining a significant result is 97.5% (assuming that we can repeat the experiment infinite number of times)
C) probability of obtaining the difference we observe given the null hypothesis is 2.5%
D) probability of the null hypothesis (no difference between the means on the population level) is 2.5%

Below you will find a number of statements which can be connected to one of the arguments against the classical statistical inference. Which of these statements is true?
A) By testing (trying to reject) a point null hypothesis, we tend to focus on alternative hypotheses that are weak and lacking precision and content.
B) Hypothesis "μ1 < μ2" is weaker than hypothesis "μ1 ≠ μ2".
C) A point null hypothesis almost certainly true (given an appropriate level of precision).
D) None of them.
ANSWER: A

Which of these statements is true?
A) If a given scientific journal accepts for publication papers with results significant at the alpha level .05 only, then around 5% of the papers published in the journal present false results.
B) The probability that the 95% confidence interval calculated around a particular sample mean includes the true population mean is 95%.
C) A relatively wide confidence interval, when the result is non-significant, suggests that the test was not sensitive enough.
D) Six studies comparing mean intelligence in two different populations were conducted. Each time the same direction of the difference was observed. However, none of the observed differences were significant. Therefore there is no reason to reject the null hypothesis (about lack of the difference)
ANSWER: C
